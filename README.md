# Artilect: A Modular AI Agent Framework

Artilect is a project aimed at building a modular, extensible, and intelligent framework for constructing sophisticated AI agents capable of dynamic task management, proactive user interaction and interaction with external systems. Itâ€™s inspired by architectural principles outlined in the book ["Symphony of Thought"](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/symphony-of-thought-david-shapiro/1142248298) by David Shapiro.

It's currently a work in progress in a very early stage.
